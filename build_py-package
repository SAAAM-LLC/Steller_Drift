Building the Package

From the root directory:

python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Testing Locally

Install the package locally to test:

pip install dist/saAam-core-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

Run the endpoint:

python -m saAam_core.server.endpoint


Deployment

For deployment, use a private repository or an internal PyPI-like system:

    Private Hosting:
        Use AWS CodeArtifact, Nexus, or GitHub Packages.
    Install in Production:

pip install --extra-index-url <your-private-repo-url> saAam-core


#########

 Testing and Refinement

    Run the Full System:
        Launch main.py or interact with the endpoint to test NPC behavior, world updates, and player interactions.
    Monitor Performance:
        Add centralized logging in logging_util.py to capture key events.
    Iterate on Core Modules:
        Test consciousness evolution and memory integration for edge cases.

6. Ready for Action

With SaAaM-Core, you have:

    A secure, modular Python package.
    A local endpoint for managing interactions.
    Room to expand without exposing core logic.
